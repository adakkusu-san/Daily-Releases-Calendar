As you might see, I haven't updated this for quite a while (no time), and I don't think I will continue to. I will maybe help out the other person, but not more than that.

#### Note
At the moment, thanks /u/Veakon for dedicating some of their time for making these daily posts.

Neither I, /u/Veakon or the subreddit /r/CrackWatch, link to any so-called "illegal", warez or cracked files. Only to information files that also don't contain any link to earlier mentioned files. Don't ask us for them, instead do the research yourself, thanks.
